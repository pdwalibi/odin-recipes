       <h2>Description</h2>
       <p>This recipe has several steps and you will need to start at least a few hours before eating, but don't let this put you off. It is well worth the effort, as you will end up with a scrumptious butter chicken to show for it.</p>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sawce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>600 grams tomato purée
                <ul>
                    <li>I use the Mutti Passata</li>

            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>5 pods green cardamom (do not crush)</li>
            <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>4 cloves</li>

                <ul>

            <li>1 teaspoon salt (to taste)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoons Garam masala</li>
            <li>1/3 cup coconut cream</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <p>Put the ginger and garlic into a blender and puree. You may need to add a bit of water to make it go. If you don't have a blender, you can finely grate by hand.
        In a small bowl, whisk the yoghurt, olive oil, salt, garam masala, saffron, and 2 teaspoons of the garlic ginger mixture together. Save the remaining garlic ginger mixture for the sauce.
        Put the chicken in a freezer bag and pour the marinade all over it, rubbing it into the chicken. Squeeze all the air out of the bag and seal it. Marinate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight.

        <p>
        <p>Add the butter to a pot along with the cardamom, cinnamon and cloves. Fry the mixture until the cloves are puffy. Use lowish heat so you don’t brown the butter too much.
        <p>Add the chili peppers, and remaining garlic ginger mixture and saute until browned, and very fragrant.
        <p>Add the tomato purée and tomato paste and cook this mixture over medium heat until the tomatoes have become very thick and paste-like (30-45 minutes). <p>Once the mixture starts sputtering you'll want to stir it pretty regularly to keep the sputtering under control while maintaining enough heat to reduce the liquid.
        <ul>
            <li>Tip: before opening the lid and stirring, move the pot off the heat and let the sputtering reduce, otherwise you will coat the stovetop with sauce!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        <p>While the tomatoes are reducing, grill the chicken. If you don’t have a BBQ, an oven grill will do, but in either case it needs to be very hot. You want to get the outside lightly charred, but you don't want to cook the chicken all the way through as it will finish cooking in the sauce. If you cook it completely now, it will get overcooked in the sauce later. 
        <p>
        <p>Let the chicken rest for at least 10 minutes before cutting.
        <p>When the tomato mixture is done caramelizing, turn off the heat. Using a pair of tongs, pick out as much of the aromatics as you can (cinnamon, chilli, cloves, etc).
        <ul>
            <li>if you have a coarse wire strainer/sieve, use that to strain the sauce into another saucepan, pressing on the solids with a silicone spatula to get as much sauce through as you can.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        <p>Cut the chicken into large chunks and add it to the pot with the sauce along with the salt and garam masala. Don’t add too much salt - it’s easy to overdo this. Cook the mixture for 6-8 minutes over medium heat until the chicken is cooked through.
        <p>Add the coconut cream and stir together and then turn the heat off. Plate the butter chicken and drizzle a little extra cream on top.
        <p>Garnish with some coriander leaves. Serve on top of fluffy boiled white rice, with plain Greek yoghurt on the side. Enjoy!
